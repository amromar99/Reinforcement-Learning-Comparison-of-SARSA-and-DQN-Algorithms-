# Reinforcement-Learning-Comparison-of-SARSA-and-DQN-Algorithms-
This project evaluates SARSA and Deep Q-Network (DQN) in the Frozen Lake environment, focusing on both deterministic and stochastic settings. It compares how each algorithm navigates the grid to reach a goal while avoiding hazards, highlighting their strengths and limitations in handling uncertainty and complexity.
